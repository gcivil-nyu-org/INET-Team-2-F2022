"American Buddhist Study Center, Inc.","<p><strong>History of the American Buddhist Study Center</strong></p>

<p>American Buddhist Study Center was originally founded in 1951 by the late Reverend Hozen Seki. At that time the Study Center’s name was The American Buddhist Academy. Back then Reverend Seki’s wanted to enlighten the spirit and the minds of Americans to the great compassion, wisdom, and teachings of Amida Buddha. </p>

<p>The American Buddhist Study Center is committed to providing Americans with greater knowledge and understanding into the teachings of the Buddha, and the teachings of Shin Buddhism – the most common form of Buddhism practiced in Japan. For over the past 67 years we have invited well known Buddhist scholars, authors, monks, and ministers to speak at our Study Center events. Most noteworthy was D.T. Suzuki, the man who introduced Zen to America. </p>

<p>The Study Center also is a Buddhist book publishing house.  Our most recent publication is Lady Takeko Kujo’s book “<em>Leaves of My Heart""</em>. Lady Kujo was a renowned poet, writer, artist, activist, and humanitarian.  She was one of Japan’s leading women during the 20<sup>th</sup> century. “<em>Leaves of My Heart</em>,” is a collection of profound essays reinforcing Buddhist values introducing to the world a voice which, until now, has been largely unknown outside of Shin Buddhist circles. </p>

<p>Today, the ABSC is an active organization holding Buddhist discussions, lectures, workshops, and symposiums.  Our mission continues in the founder’s footsteps introducing Buddhist values and Japanese Culture to America.</p>

JustLeadershipUSA,"<p><strong>Mission</strong></p>

<p>JustLeadershipUSA is dedicated to cutting the US correctional population in #halfby2030. JLUSA empowers people most affected by incarceration to drive policy reform.</p>

<p>Mass incarceration is the most significant domestic threat to the fabric of our democracy. The reason for such high incarceration rates is not serious crimes but misguided policies, such as mandatory minimums, three-strikes laws and reductions in the availability of parole and other early release mechanisms. Through targeted advocacy, strengthening leadership and membership support, JustLeadershipUSA believes a decarcerated America is possible.</p>

<p><strong>History</strong></p>

<p>JLUSA was founded in November 2014 by national criminal justice reform advocate Glenn E. Martin, on the guiding principle that “those closest to the problem are closest to the solution, but furthest from resources and power”. The inspiration for JLUSA came from Mr. Martin’s personal experience, having been previously incarcerated for six years. JLUSA’s #halfby2030 mission came from Mr. Martin’s love for his youngest son, Joshua Martin, who will turn 18 in 2030.</p>

<p>As president of the organization until December 2017, Mr. Martin worked with staff to launch the bold and successful #CLOSErikers campaign, propelling JLUSA onto the national stage; engaged in unflinching and non-partisan advocacy on the federal level; and set the foundation for the agency’s multi-city advocacy work. Mr. Martin and JLUSA’s Senior Training Consultant, David K. Mensah, developed the organization’s leadership program with input from over 50 formerly incarcerated leaders from across the US, with support from the Center for Institutional and Social Change at Columbia University. The Leading with Conviction advanced leadership development program and Emerging Leaders regional trainings are an investment in the individual and collective leadership of people directly impacted by the system of mass incarceration.</p>

<p>JLUSA is the first organization in the country to call for the correctional system to be halved, and has inspired a movement of people and new organizations to follow our mission toward decarceration. From closing toxic jails and prisons to reforming pretrial laws, barriers to employment, and the wider system of mass criminalization, JLUSA’s bold campaigns with valued partners across the U.S. amplify the voices and expertise of directly impacted people who are leading us toward #halfby2030.</p>","JustLeadershipUSA (JLUSA) is dedicated to cutting the US correctional population in half by 2030.

Reclaim Pride Coalition,"<p>The Queer* Liberation March and Rally is being held on June 30th, 2019 on the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall rebellion, at the same time as “World Pride” in New York City.  We are organizing this march to honor the legacy of Queer Liberation struggles—past and present, to demand liberation by resisting continued forms of oppression, and to celebrate the hard-fought gains won through Queer resistance.</p>

<p><strong>WE REMEMBER </strong></p>

<p>On June 28th, 1969, patrons of  the Stonewall Inn fought back against state violence by refusing to continue to be the targets of police brutality. Gender non-conforming women of color, queer youth, drag queens, sex workers, lesbians, gay men, and radical allies rebelled for several days in front of the Stonewall Inn and began building what would become some of the most important organizations in the modern ‘Gay Liberation Movement.’</p>

<p>The Stonewall rebellion must be understood in a wider history of Queer rebellion against state violence and institutional discrimination overtaking the U.S. during the late ‘60s and early ‘70s. These early rebellions emerged in the context of counter-cultural movements, during which many organizations were formed in coalition and solidarity with other people’s struggles across the country and around the globe such as Black liberation movements and the movement against the war in Vietnam. Their mission statements were inherently intersectional.   </p>

<p>The Compton Cafeteria Uprising of 1966 in California , one of the first queer uprisings, consisted of gender non-conforming queers, drag queens, street youth and sex workers fighting back against harassment and police brutality. The organization Vanguard, formed in 1965, was active in the Compton Cafeteria protests and largely consisted of transient, homeless, and working class queer youth.</p>

<p>In 1970 Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson, gender non-conforming Latina and Black activists at the forefront of the Stonewall Rebellion and early gay liberation activism, created STAR (Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries), a radical street activist organization that provided housing and support to sex workers and homeless queer youth.</p>

<p>In 1970, Black Lesbians in Boston formed the Combahee River Collective, dedicated to “actively struggling against racial, sexual, heterosexual, and class oppression,” noting that “the major systems of oppression are interlocking.”  </p>

<p>The Gay Liberation Front emerged after the Stonewall rebellion and organized the first anniversary march, which would later become NYC’s - annual Gay Pride March.</p>

<p>Connecting queer liberation to all struggles for liberation, the GLF believed that “Our fight against homosexual oppression is one with the revolutionary struggle of all oppressed peoples…”. That first march’s route in 1970 went past the Women’s House of Detention, where Joan Bird and Afeni Shakur, members of the “Black Panther 21”, were housed. In an act of solidarity, members of that first Gay Liberation march shouted, “Free our sisters, Free ourselves” as they marched by.</p>

<p>It is in this spirit of solidarity and coalition that we remember Stonewall and commemorate the ongoing struggles and rebellion of queer people across the world. We continue to work toward our full liberation and an end to the persecution of sexual and gender minorities. While we have highlighted only a small slice of Queer rebellion specific to the U.S., these moments occurred in a longer history of rebellion, including the homophile movement, Aids activism, and movements for transgender rights. The Daughters of Bilitis, the Mattachine Society, Act-Up, and STAR being some of the many organizations fundamental to the gains won by Queer people across the world.</p>

<p>We see our own struggles tied to the liberation of other oppressed peoples across the world. While New York is celebrating “World Pride”, we must acknowledge the  oppression faced by Queer people across the world, as well as our own imperial policies of state-sanctioned xenophobia (like the travel ban) and constant wars that are detrimental to the lives of all people across the globe. People’s rights and liberties are being stripped at this very moment in the U.S. and abroad, and we must continue to fight back.</p>

<p>We come together in this spirit, remembering to fight for liberation, dignity, self, and communal determination.</p>

<p><strong>We remember and we resist!</strong></p>

<p><em>*We have chosen to use the phrase Queer as an umbrella category to represent the wide span of sexual and gender minorities and outlaws who have historically and currently been oppressed. “Queer” signals for us a political stance of rebellion and a demand for liberation more-so than simply an identity category. We are trans, bisexual, lesbian, gay, queer, intersex, asexual, two-spirit, non-binary, and gender non-conforming individuals and communities.  </em></p>","The Reclaim Pride Coalition brings together activists, both groups and individuals, concerned with the rights of sexual minorities, in order to organize a non-corporate, minimally policed march in the original political spirit of Pride.",Attn:  Lily Acunzo,"57 Willoughby Street, 2nd Fl.",Brooklyn,NY,11201,http://www.griptape.org,,,,,,,,,

The Uni Project,"<p>The Uni Project creates learning environments in public space across New York City. Using custom-designed infrastructure, we pop-up in parks, plazas, and other public spaces to offer reading, drawing, and hands-on experiences for all ages. We partner with community organizations and city agencies, and we prioritize underserved locations. We also send kits around the world so that other cities can copy our model. We do this work to improve the urban environment, strengthen New York City neighborhoods, and make education a visible, enjoyable part of urban life.</p>

<p><strong>What’s a Uni?</strong><br />
The Uni began as a portable reading room but has since expanded into a platform for offering a range of innovative educational programming. Built like a stage case, each Uni unfolds to reveal different experiences for the public. DRAW turns the Uni into a portable drawing studio with fine art materials to use alongside an artist-in-residence. EXPLORE brings natural science to the street with microscopes, magnifying glasses, and specimens. SOLVE offers math and spatial reasoning puzzles. BUILD offers hands-on design and engineering challenges. The original READ offers a curated collection of books and a place to sit and read. Everything is free to the public and overseen by professional staff with support from volunteers. Award-winning designs elevate the look and feel of each place the Uni visits.</p>

<p><strong>What happens</strong><br />
The Uni attracts attention and encourages community gathering. People are transformed into readers, artists, and learners on a kind of stage, and feel proud. Neighborhoods are transformed into places where the value of learning can be recognized, promoted and shared. Access to books and educational materials increases and people’s sense of community safety increases, especially for children, women, and families. People walk away feeling good about themselves, their community, and the city. These outcomes have positive implications for several long-standing urban issues, including educational achievement gaps, social isolation, and community fragmentation.</p>

UHAB,"<p>The Urban Homesteading Assistance Board was born in the midst of New York City’s economic crisis of the 1970s.</p>

<p>With landlords abandoning their buildings <em>en masse</em>, the city found itself with more than 11,000 buildings on hand and no idea what to do with them. UHAB became a voice for the residents living in those buildings – longtime New Yorkers who had no intention of leaving.</p>

<p>Turning buildings over to their residents to manage began as an experiment. But soon the city was convinced that this revolutionary approach could be sustained. The first year UHAB offered training, in Harlem, residents of 200 buildings learned how to cooperatively govern and operate their own multi-family dwellings.</p>

<p>We have only grown since then.</p>

<p>UHAB has now assisted in the preservation of more than 1,600 buildings (comprising 1,350 housing cooperatives), creating homeownership opportunities for residents of more than 30,000 apartments.  </p>

Uweza Foundation,"<p>Overview </p>

<p>WHO WE ARE </p>

<p>We work in the Kibera slum, the largest slum in Nairobi, Kenya, home to over 500,000 people living in extreme poverty, more than half under age 18. In addition to poor housing, residents lack toilets and access to running water, proper sanitation and quality healthcare. </p>

<p>Focused on meeting their basic needs, with inadequate resources and support, many smart, talented young people end up engaging in harmful behaviors and activities that have the potential to negatively alter their entire lives. </p>

<p>Uweza recognizes that Kibera residents are creative, resilient and resourceful and that sustainable change requires a future generation that is more educated, motivated and empowered. </p>

<p>Founded in 2008, today we provide 300-400 </p>

<p>Kenyan children and youth with unique opportunities to pursue a path to a better future through the discovery and development of their talents and abilities – gaining education and ultimately earning incomes that utilize their own inherent strengths. </p>

<p>We seek and nurture long-term relationships with individual children and youth to have a more lasting and impactful effect, versus a short-term emergency response to young peoples’ needs. </p>

<p>All 12 of our staff live in Kibera. We know the community well, and we work out of the Uweza Community Center, which opened in 2011. We developed our programs in response to needs expressed by Kibera community members, and our work evolves in response to both formal and informal feedback collected from program participants and their parents/guardians. </p>

<p>We achieve a lot with a very small budget (approximately $150,000) and an American board of directors, both of which we are looking to grow. </p>

<p>WHAT WE DO </p>

<p>Uweza Soccer Academy </p>

<p>Soccer is very popular among youth in Kibera and our largest and most well-known program in Kenya making it possible to reach vulnerable children and youth in ways that might not have otherwise been possible. We use soccer as a vehicle to promote life skills and the importance of education. Coaches act as mentors and learn each child’s personality and background, enabling Uweza to connect them to other resources. 120 children and young adults participate in our award-winning, age-specific teams for both boys/men and girls/women. The Uweza Soccer Academy is pioneering girls’ participation in sports in Kibera. Women’s soccer still suffers from lack of interest and investment, and we continue to push for more resources, funding and attention for women’s sports. Several former soccer players are now in college/university and current careers/ occupations of former soccer players include artist, comedian, teacher, referee, coach, professional soccer player and business owner. Nine former and current soccer players are currently employed by Uweza.</p>

<p>Sponsorship/Scholarship Program </p>

<p>Education is extremely important to Kibera families, who recognize its potential to lift students out of poverty. Although both primary and high school have been declared free by the Kenyan government, there are fees associated with attending school that many families can’t afford. In this community, the Sponsorship Program is Uweza’s most frequently requested program/service. Currently, we provide 66 scholarships to primary students attending local schools; secondary students most of whom attend boarding schools outside of Kibera; and post-secondary students who attend vocational schools and colleges. Scholarships cover the costs of school fees, school uniforms, school supplies, mentorship and guidance and life skills workshops. </p>

<p>Art Program </p>

<p>There are no opportunities for creative expression or development of artistic talent in most Kenyan schools, and opportunities to participate in art for Kibera children and youth are extremely limited, despite a plethora of artistic talent. The Uweza Art Gallery opened in 2013 to provide art students with their own space and materials to paint and market their artwork, which is sold online, at the gallery and through events and exhibitions. 60% of all sales goes to the artist and/or to his/her school fees if the artist is under 18. 40% of sales goes back into the gallery to pay rent and purchase supplies. As of 2018, the gallery is currently self-sustaining through sales of artwork. Several of the artists have been able to pay the entirety of their primary, high school and post-secondary education through the sales of their artwork, and many of the older artists are able to fully support themselves through their sales. Uweza Art Gallery also hosts art classes for children from Kibera twice a week. </p>

<p>Golden Girls Power </p>

<p>Insecurity in Kibera and the risk of assault and sexual harassment makes it more difficult for girls to be able to gather and meet in public spaces, whereas young men and boys commonly spend their days at “bases” scattered throughout the slum. Our girls’ empowerment club provides Kibera girls with a safe space to meet, socialize, discuss and learn about topics that are relevant to improving their mental, emotional and physical well-being. </p>

<p>The club is divided into two groups by age, and each group meets once a week. Led by a female facilitator who teaches through drama, group work, song, dance, debate, audiovisual materials and discussion groups, club members also take trips outside of Kibera and are visited by guest facilitators. In addition, the club provides an opportunity to provide individualized attention and assistance to girls who are going through challenges and are in need of advice and support from caring peers and adults. </p>

<p>Bright Futures </p>

<p>The goal of this young women’s economic empowerment group is to help women become </p>

<p>financially independent. Activities are developed and implemented by the members themselves and are communal in nature, with all members participating and benefiting. Current group activities include group savings and making and selling of liquid soap products. The group also discusses one life skills topic at each meeting related to motherhood and womanhood. Group members have also taken on jobs at the Uweza Community Center such as washing uniforms for the soccer team and cleaning the center to earn a small amount of income for themselves and their families.
